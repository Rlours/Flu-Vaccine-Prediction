Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines - Benchmark
1️⃣ Project Title & Overview
Flu Shot Learning: Predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines
To predict the likelihood of individuals receiving the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines based on demographic and behavioral features.

2️⃣ Dataset Description
The phone survey asked people whether they had received H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines, in conjunction with information they shared about their lives, opinions, and behaviors. A better understanding of how these characteristics have been associated with personal vaccination patterns may provide guidance for future public health efforts.

Target Variables:
h1n1_vaccine → (1 if received H1N1 vaccine, 0 otherwise)
seasonal_vaccine → (1 if received seasonal flu vaccine, 0 otherwise)
Features Include:
Demographics (age, gender, race, income)
Health-related conditions (chronic diseases, doctor visits)
Behavioral aspects (concern about flu, media exposure)

3️⃣ Problem Statement
The goal is to build a model that predicts the probability of an individual receiving the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines.
